## About Me
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory. My research focuses on building fundamental connections between control and machine learning. Currently I am most interested in

'+' System/control tools for designing robust deep neural networks
'+' Connections between robust control and reinforcement learning
'+' Control-theoretic tools for analysis and design of iterative algorithms in optimization and learning

I received the B.Sc. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2008, and received the M.S. in Computational Mechanics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010. I received the Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Minnesota in 2016, under the supervision of Peter Seiler. Between July 2016 and July 2018, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At Madison, I was working with Laurent Lessard and closely collaborating with Stephen Wright. In 2021, I received the NSF CAREER award and the Amazon research award.
